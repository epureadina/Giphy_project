    This project is used for consumes the giphy.com api. At first sight, the user can see the first 50 trending gifs.

The user can type a word in the input field and the application gives the first 10 gifs.
The searched ghiphy word is saved in localStorage.
This one with the first 10 gifs is saved on a remote database on firebase.

If there are problems regarding the api call,the emptiness of the search fiels or the no search giphy exist ,the application return an error alert.
When the data is loading ,the application show a spinner on the screen.

I hope you enjoy the application :)
